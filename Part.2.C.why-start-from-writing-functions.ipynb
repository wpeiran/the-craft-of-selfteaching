    "为了顺利启动第一部分的 “阅读”，特意找了个不一样的入口，“布尔运算”；第二部分，从 “阅读” 过渡到 “写作”，我也同样特意寻找了一个不一样的入口：**从函数开始写起**。\n",
    "\n",
    "*从小入手，从来都是自学的好方法*。我们没有想着一上来就写程序，而是写 “子程序”、“小程序”、“短程序”。从结构化编程的角度来看，写函数的一个基本要求就是：\n",

    "> - 只完成一个功能；\n",
    "> - 没有任何错误地只完成一个功能……\n",

    "\n",
    "你要习惯，归纳、总结、整理的工作，从来都不是一次就能完成的，都需要反复多次之后才能彻底完成。必须习惯这种流程 —— 而不是像那些从未自学过的人一样，对这种东西想当然地全不了解。\n",
    "\n",
    "另外，从现代编程方法论来看，“写作” 部分一上来就从函数入手也的确是 “更正确” 的，因为结构化编程的核心就是拆分任务，把任务拆分到不能再拆分为止 —— 什么时候不能再拆分了呢？就是当一个函数只完成一个功能的时候……"
